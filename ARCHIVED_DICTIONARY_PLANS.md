# Archived Dictionary Plans

This file contains links to previous dictionary planning documents that have been superseded by the final implementation.

## Superseded Plans

These plans were created during the exploration phase and have been replaced by the final implementation documented in:
- `DICTIONARY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (comprehensive plan)
- `DICTIONARY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (completed implementation summary)

### Original Plans (Archived):
1. **UNIFIED_DICTIONARY_PLAN.md** - Initial unified approach
2. **SIMPLIFIED_DICTIONARY_PLAN.md** - Simplified FreeDict + Wiktionary approach  
3. **LEO_DICTIONARY_DESIGN.md** - Leo-dictionary style design

## Current Implementation

The final implementation uses:
- **Primary Source**: FreeDict English-German (eng-deu) dictionary only
- **Database**: SQLite with comprehensive schema
- **Features**: Bidirectional search (EN↔DE), gender display, grammar extraction
- **Storage**: ~100MB offline dictionary
- **UI**: Material 3 design with search, results, and management

## Migration Path

All previous dictionary code has been replaced with the new system:
- Old `FreedictReader.kt` → New file readers and parsers
- Old `DictionaryRepository.kt` → New `DictionaryRepository.kt`
- Old entities → New `DictionaryEntry` entity
- Old DAOs → New `DictionaryDao`

The old planning documents are kept for historical reference only.
